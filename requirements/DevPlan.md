# Development Plan for Car Rental System (MVVM+C Architecture)

## 1.. Architecture Overview

### MVVM+C Components

- **Models**: Data structures representing business entities
- **Views**: User interface components
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and data presentation logic that connects models to views
- **Controllers**: Flow coordinators and navigation controllers

### Directory Structure

```
src/
├── models/          # Data models and business entities
├── views/           # UI components and screens
├── viewmodels/      # Business logic and data binding
└── controllers/     # Navigation and flow coordination
```
